# About Me

I am a second year Ph.D. student in **Computer Engineering** at **[Northeastern University]**, **[College of Engineering]**. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yun Raymond Fu](https://www1.ece.neu.edu/~yunfu/) at **[Smilelab]**. My research focuses on **[your main research topic, e.g., efficient fine-tuning methods for large language models, microplastic concentration prediction, or the impact of human activities on environmental pollutants]**. My broader research interests include **[list key areas, e.g., deep learning, high-performance computing, optimization, embedded systems]**.

## Academic Background

- **Ph.D. in Computer Engineering**, [Northeastern University], [Fall 2023] – Present  
- **M.Sc. in Computer Engineering**, [Northeastern University], [Fall 2021] – [Fall 2022]  
- **B.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering**, [Xidian University], [Fall 2017] – [Spring 2021]  

## Research Interests

My research broadly covers **[your key research areas, e.g., machine learning, computer vision, optimization]**. Specifically, I focus on:
- **[Main topic 1]** (e.g., neural network pruning, sparse training, etc.)
- **[Main topic 2]** (e.g., efficient AI model adaptation, transfer learning, etc.)
- **[Main topic 3]** (e.g., multimodal learning, computational imaging, etc.)

I am always interested in collaborating on related topics and open to discussions.
